# Chatbot 
This is a small js file with a dummy chatbot. 
The chatbot will:
- Ask for the users name
- Ask for the users birth year
- Guess the users name by using the remainder 3, remainder 5 and remainder 7 formula
- Count from 0 until a number that the user enters
- Do a small test with the user 

This js file uses the "sync-input" module from the Hyperskil learning website to ask for user input.
